I&#8217;ve read everything he&#8217;s written and couldn&#8217;t wait for my copy of Safe Haven to arrive.Safe Haven had a different feel than many of Nicholas Sparks books. It was much less sappy than most of his books. Don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8230; I love sappy but this book was much deeper than many of his other books. It explored life in an abusive relationship and the struggle to escape and start over.I felt a connection to the characters and never lost interest in the story. The audio narration was well done. The only thing that annoyed me was the whiny voice the narrator used for 5 year old Kristen. Fortunately she didn&#8217;t have many lines in the book.This book played out in a predictable manner. Although one thing I have learned from reading Nicholas Sparks is that sometimes he is not predictable and he goes for the heart-break ending. This book did have an unpredictable element to the ending but thankfully it was a touching unpredictable and not a heart-breaking unpredictable.Content: Just a couple of swear words. One of the characters in this book is psycho, I mean seriously crazy. We hear his demented crazy thought process and the details of some of the things he does are described. There are scenes of physical abuse described and a few sex scenes that aren&#8217;t overly graphic but are lewd. Although I can&#8217;t classify this book as clean it wasn&#8217;t nearly as graphic as it could have been. It was well written and I would recommend it to adults who have read this content warning.Rating: 4 Stars. I made it through this book in less than 2 days. Some great writing from Nicholas Sparks.Source: I received an audio version of this book from Hachette.\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"Great writing from Nicholas Sparks.\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1404518400, \"reviewTime\": \"07 5, 2014\"}\n",

Broken World was so touching and emotional because you go from Mia's trauma to her trying to cope.

I was so in the moment with Broken World and hurt with Mia because she was surrounded by people but so alone and I understood her feelings.
